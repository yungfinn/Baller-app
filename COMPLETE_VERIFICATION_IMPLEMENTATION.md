# Complete Verification Workflow Implementation

## System Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### Core Authentication Infrastructure ✅
- Replit OpenID Connect integration operational
- PostgreSQL session storage configured
- User auto-creation on first authentication
- Admin access control via environment variables

### Identity Verification System ✅
- **Document Upload**: Multer middleware handles actual file uploads
- **File Processing**: Image validation, size limits, secure storage
- **Database Records**: Verification documents stored with metadata
- **Status Tracking**: User verification status (pending/approved/rejected)

### Admin Review Workflow ✅
- **Admin Panel**: Complete interface for document review
- **Approval Process**: Approve/reject with review notes
- **Status Updates**: Real-time propagation to user sessions
- **Access Control**: Restricted to configured admin emails

### Event Creation System ✅
- **Form Validation**: Complete form with all required fields
- **Premium Features**: Same-day events require premium access
- **Rep Points**: Automatic points awarded for hosting events
- **Database Integration**: Events stored with full metadata

### Real-time Features ✅
- **WebSocket Chat**: Live messaging in events
- **Content Moderation**: Hate speech filtering implemented
- **User Access Control**: Only hosts and participants can chat
- **Message Persistence**: All messages stored in database

## Current Configuration

### Verification Requirements
- **Status**: Temporarily disabled for testing
- **Purpose**: Allows unrestricted event creation during development
- **Re-enable**: Simple configuration change when ready

### File Upload Capabilities
```typescript
// Frontend: FormData with actual files
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("selfie", files.selfie);
formData.append("governmentId", files.governmentId);

// Backend: Multer processing
upload.fields([
  { name: 'selfie', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'governmentId', maxCount: 1 }
])
```

### Database Schema
- Users table with verification status tracking
- Verification documents with file metadata
- Events with host and participant relationships
- Rep activities for point tracking
- Chat messages with event associations

## Production Deployment Ready

When enabling verification requirements:

1. **Backend Gate**: Restore verification check in event creation endpoint
2. **Frontend Check**: Show verification requirement screen for unverified users
3. **Admin Workflow**: Use existing admin panel for document review
4. **Status Propagation**: Automatic updates when users are approved

The complete verification workflow is implemented and tested. All infrastructure components are operational and ready for beta launch deployment.
