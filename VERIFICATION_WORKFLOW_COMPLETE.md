# Document Upload Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The document upload system is failing due to authentication middleware preventing access to the verification upload endpoint. Users receive 401 Unauthorized errors when attempting to submit verification documents.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Session Configuration**: Cookie settings prevent proper session persistence in development
2. **Authentication Flow**: Replit OpenID Connect requires proper token refresh handling
3. **Upload Endpoint**: Multer middleware expects authenticated sessions for file processing

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features
- **Document Upload Form**: Frontend interface for selfie + government ID submission
- **File Validation**: Image type checking and 10MB size limits
- **Multer Integration**: Backend file processing with memory storage
- **Admin Review Panel**: Complete verification approval workflow
- **Database Schema**: Verification documents and user status tracking

### ⚠️ Authentication Issue
The verification upload endpoint returns 401 errors preventing document submission. This blocks the complete verification workflow from functioning.

## Immediate Fix Required
The document upload authentication needs resolution to enable:
- User document submission for identity verification
- Admin approval workflow for verification requests
- Event creation gating based on verification status

## Technical Details
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/verification/upload
- **Expected**: Authenticated users can upload verification documents
- **Current**: 401 Unauthorized responses block all upload attempts
- **Impact**: Complete verification workflow non-functional

The verification system architecture is complete but requires authentication configuration fixes to become operational for beta launch.
