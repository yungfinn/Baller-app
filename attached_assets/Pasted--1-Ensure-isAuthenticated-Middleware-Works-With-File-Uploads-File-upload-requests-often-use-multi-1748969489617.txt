âœ… 1. Ensure isAuthenticated Middleware Works With File Uploads

File upload requests often use multipart/form-data, which can interfere with cookie/session handling if not correctly configured.

Check for:

    Session cookies being properly sent with the upload request

    The upload endpoint using the isAuthenticated middleware before Multer processes the files

    CORS headers allowing credentials: 'include'

Fix Pattern:

// Correct middleware order (auth comes BEFORE multer)
app.post('/api/verification/upload', 
  isAuthenticated, 
  upload.fields([{ name: 'selfie' }, { name: 'governmentId' }]), 
  async (req, res) => { ... });

âœ… 2. Client-Side: Ensure credentials: 'include' in Fetch Request

When sending files via fetch, you must include session credentials explicitly:

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("selfie", files.selfie);
formData.append("governmentId", files.governmentId);

await fetch("/api/verification/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
  credentials: "include", // ðŸ”‘ Required for auth session
});

âœ… 3. Session Cookie Setup (Backend)

In express-session setup (likely in replitAuth.ts), ensure:

cookie: {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  sameSite: "lax", // Or "none" if cross-origin
  maxAge: sessionTtl,
}

Also check:

    app.use(session(...)) is loaded before all routes

    cookie-parser is initialized if required

âœ… 4. Multer + Auth Debugging

Add debug logs in isAuthenticated to ensure it:

    Sees the session cookie

    Is able to read the user ID (req.user.claims.sub)

const isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Session:", req.session);
  console.log("User claims:", req.user?.claims);
  ...
}

âœ… 5. Test Flow

Use browser network dev tools to:

    Inspect the request headers (are cookies present?)

    Check the response from the /api/verification/upload call

    Ensure 401 errors aren't coming from missing or expired sessions

ðŸ§© Final Fallback (Temporary for Beta)

If session issues persist, consider:

    Temporarily removing isAuthenticated from the upload route

    Logging req.headers.cookie and req.user to manually verify auth flow
