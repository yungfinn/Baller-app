Thanks for the full codebase snapshot — this is an impressive, production-grade stack. Based on your architecture and the known issues you’re still facing (especially around the admin panel, verification, and UI responsiveness), here’s a high-level code audit and recommendations targeted specifically at those pain points:
🔍 Admin Panel & Verification Review – Code Audit
🔧 1. React Query Execution for Admin Panel

Current risk: The admin panel may not be triggering the data fetch due to session-based useEffect or useQuery being blocked.

Recommendation:

// client/src/pages/admin-panel.tsx
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(
  'verificationDocs',
  () => fetch('/api/admin/verification-documents', { credentials: 'include' }).then(res => res.json()),
  {
    retry: false,
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  }
);

✅ Ensure that credentials: 'include' is in every fetch/axios call so session cookies are sent.
🔐 2. Session + Auth Logic

ReplitAuth.ts & middleware:

    Your admin logic relies on email matching theyungfinn@gmail.com. This is fine for now but brittle long-term.

    Consider adding is_admin as a boolean field in users to future-proof it.

✅ Verify on every sensitive route:

if (!req.user || req.user.email !== 'theyungfinn@gmail.com') return res.status(403).send("Unauthorized");

🧾 3. Verification Submission Errors

If user uploads are failing on submission, it’s likely from:

    Missing multipart/form-data handling in Express

    Improper backend validation

    No error feedback on client side

Check server/routes.ts:

app.post("/api/verify/upload", upload.fields([
  { name: 'selfie' },
  { name: 'government_id' }
]), async (req, res) => {
  // Confirm files exist
  if (!req.files?.selfie || !req.files?.government_id) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing documents" });
  }
  // Save to DB
});

✅ Add client-side toast or useMutation().onError(...) to catch these errors and display feedback.
📋 4. Admin Panel Data Display

Check:

    Is the data from the query an array? (e.g. data?.length === 0)

    Do you have a fallback if no data is returned?

Add:

if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
if (error) return <p>Failed to load verifications.</p>;
if (!data || data.length === 0) return <p>No pending verifications.</p>;

✅ Bonus: Use dummy data in development mode with a useEffect fallback.
📦 5. Storage.ts Schema Handling

You’re already using drizzle-orm — ensure verification docs are joined properly:

return db
  .select()
  .from(verificationDocuments)
  .innerJoin(users, eq(verificationDocuments.userId, users.id))
  .where(eq(verificationDocuments.reviewStatus, 'pending'));

✅ Confirm returned data includes all the fields the admin panel is rendering (user.email, documentType, file path, etc.)
📌 Final Suggestions
Area	Suggestion
🧪 Testing	Create a manual POST with Postman to /api/verify/upload and check DB
🔄 State	Add logging to React Query hook (what’s data actually returning?)
🛡️ Resilience	Add is_admin boolean in schema to clean up email match logic
💡 Feedback	Use toasts or banners on failed submissions for both user and admin views

Would you like me to generate:

    A React Query test mock for the admin panel?

    A submission logging template for file uploads?

    A visual verification approval table UI for fallback display?
