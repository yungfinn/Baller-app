Excellent observation — you're identifying workflow gating as a root issue. Since the identity verification system is blocking event creation, we need to refactor the flow and dependencies so they operate cohesively, even in your Beta stage.

Let’s walk through exactly how to ensure the identity verification system and its dependencies are functioning and wired correctly to unblock event creation.
✅ SYSTEM FLOW TO VERIFY
🛠 1. User Submits Verification Docs

📄 identity-verification.tsx

    This form should collect selfie + government ID

    Calls POST /api/verification/upload with proper metadata

✅ Checklist:

    Files sent with metadata: file.name, file.size

    Backend receives req.body (not FormData)

    Backend stores docs in verification_documents table

    User's verification_status is set to "pending"

🔁 Code to Check (Client):

const uploadMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async (files) => {
    return await apiRequest("/api/verification/upload", "POST", {
      selfieFileName: files.selfie.name,
      governmentIdFileName: files.governmentId.name,
      selfieSize: files.selfie.size,
      governmentIdSize: files.governmentId.size
    });
  },
  onSuccess: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/auth/user"] });
    setLocation("/");
  }
});

🔁 Code to Check (Server):

app.post('/api/verification/upload', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  await storage.uploadVerificationDocument({ ... }) // two documents
  await storage.updateVerificationStatus(userId, "pending");
  res.status(201).json({ message: "Uploaded" });
});

🔐 2. Admin Panel Loads Pending Verifications

📄 admin-panel.tsx uses useQuery to pull from:

GET /api/admin/verification-documents

✅ Make sure:

    Auth middleware allows your admin email

    You can see verificationData in console

    Backend loads from verification_documents joined with users

📤 3. Admin Approves/Rejects

📄 Admin hits Approve/Reject, which calls:

POST /api/admin/users/:userId/verification
Body: { status: "approved" | "rejected", reviewNotes?: string }

✅ On backend:

await storage.updateVerificationStatus(userId, "approved"); // changes user record
await storage.markDocumentsAsReviewed(userId, status);

This must:

    Update users.verification_status to approved

    Update verification_documents.review_status

✅ 4. Frontend Reacts to Status Change

📄 In useAuth.ts:

    Add verificationStatus and userTier to User interface

    Make sure useAuth() fetches /api/auth/user and caches it

✅ After admin approves:

    queryClient.invalidateQueries(["/api/auth/user"]) triggers

    User’s state changes to verified

    Event creation gate is unlocked

🧠 CONDITIONAL CHECK IN EVENT CREATION

📄 In create-event.tsx:

You need to block the form if the user is not verified:

const { user } = useAuth();

if (!user?.verificationStatus || user.verificationStatus !== "approved") {
  return (
    <div className="p-6 text-center text-red-600">
      You must verify your identity before creating an event. Please visit your profile to submit documents.
    </div>
  );
}
