🏞️ 1. Can Users Coordinate at Public Places Like Parks?
✅ Generally Yes — If:

    It’s a public park, court, or field that doesn’t require a permit for casual use

    Group size is under local permit thresholds (usually <25-50 people)

    No money is exchanged (e.g. for tickets or paid entry)

    The event isn’t blocking other public users

⚠️ May Require Permission If:

    It's a school field or gym — even if open, it's not truly public

    Lights, restrooms, or staff are needed (reservation required)

    The group is charging money, using branding, or bringing outside vendors (like food trucks)

🛑 2. Locations You Should Not Allow by Default

    Private schools, rec centers, or gyms without formal partnership

    Businesses (gyms, complexes) unless they’ve signed up as verified hosts

    Restricted-access venues (gated fields, members-only clubs)

✅ 3. Recommended Submission Requirements
📍 When a User Submits a Location:

    Ask: “Is this a public space available for free use?”

    Require: Pin-drop or address + type of venue (park, gym, school, etc.)

    Optional: Upload 1 photo to verify condition/visibility of space

    Show: “Pending Review” until it’s manually approved (or auto-approved if public)

🧾 Optional Additional Checks:

    Add a checkbox: “I confirm this location does not require a reservation or permit for casual group play under 25 people.”

    Warn: “Hosts are responsible for understanding any local restrictions.”

🛡️ 4. Should Baller Screen Locations?

Yes — with tiers.
Tier	Type	Approval Method
Tier 1	Verified Public Parks	Auto-approved if matched to known database
Tier 2	User-submitted spots (parks/schools)	Manual review by Baller mod/admin
Tier 3	Private/commercial venues	Only approved if Baller has permission/license agreement
🚀 Future-Proofing Ideas:

    Integrate with Google Places API to verify real public parks/courts

    Offer “Verified Host Locations” with logos and perks for gyms, centers, etc.

    Build a report button on all locations so players can flag outdated or invalid venues
