🌍 Upgrade Plan: Add a Geo-Mapped Location Picker

Here’s how to frame it for Replit or your dev console:

    “We’d like to implement a map-based location picker in Baller. Instead of users typing an address when creating an event, we want them to tap a location pin on a map to select from verified locations (like Washington County Regional Park), or drop a custom pin to host somewhere new. Map should show all verified: true locations from the database.”

✅ Core Features to Implement
📌 1. Interactive Map for Event Creation

    Display map on the "Create Event" screen

    Auto-load pins for all verified locations from the database

    Allow users to tap a pin to auto-fill location details (name, address, lat/lng)

🗺️ 2. “Drop a Pin” for Custom Locations

    Optional: let verified users drop a pin on the map (lat/lng)

    Fill address via reverse geocoding (Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap)

    Store new location request as pending: true until reviewed

🧠 3. Filter/Search by Radius or Type

    Use geolocation to show nearby locations within a radius

    Dropdown to filter by type (e.g., “public park,” “indoor gym”)

🧰 Suggested Tools for Replit Implementation
Tool	Purpose
Mapbox GL JS or Google Maps API	Map display & interaction
Firebase/Supabase/Postgres	Pull verified locations with geo data
Geocoder API	Convert pin drop to address
React Hook Form or Context	Update form with selected location
🔁 Updated UI Flow (for Create Event Page)

    🗺️ User sees full-screen map with pins

    📍 Taps on a verified location

    📥 Location name/address auto-fill in form

    ➕ Can click “Add Custom Location” to drop a new pin if verified

💬 Bonus Tip (Framing for Replit Dev Chat):

    “Let’s replace the manual text field with a map component. Pull from the locations table where verified: true. On pin select, populate the form with that location’s name/address/coordinates. Include ability to add new pin and reverse geocode for address. Ideal UX is similar to Airbnb’s location picker or Uber’s pickup pin.”
