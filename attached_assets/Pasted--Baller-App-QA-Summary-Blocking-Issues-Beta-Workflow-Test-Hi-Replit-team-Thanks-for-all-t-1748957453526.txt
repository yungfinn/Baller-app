🔧 Baller App – QA Summary & Blocking Issues (Beta Workflow Test)

Hi Replit team,

Thanks for all the progress so far. I’ve just completed a round of QA on the current Baller build. Below is a clear breakdown of what’s working, what’s broken, and where to focus next:
✅ Working

    Authentication: Login flow is smooth with Replit OpenID

    Navigation Tabs: All 4 (Discover, My Events, Create, Profile) load correctly

    Profile Page: Shows logged-in user; admin button appears correctly for admin account

    Discover Tab: Filters previously RSVP’d events as expected

❌ Issues Identified (Blocking Beta Launch)
1. 🛑 Event Creation Not Functional

    Issue: Clicking “Create” does not post the event or provide user feedback.

    Expected Behavior: Created event should show in "My Events" under "Hosting"

    Suggested Fix: Ensure form submission is correctly wired to trigger the backend event creation route and return a success/failure toast. Verify required fields are actually passed into the DB.

2. 📄 Verification Submissions Fail Silently

    Issue: Uploading a selfie and ID results in an error or no feedback. No data is saved or visible to admin.

    Expected Behavior: Documents should be saved securely, marked as “pending,” and linked to the user for admin review.

    Suggested Fix: Audit /api/verification-upload route, ensure files are stored, and user ID is properly associated.

3. 🔒 Admin Panel Loads But Is Empty

    Issue: Page loads at /admin-panel, but no pending verifications (including seeded test data like “John Smith”) are displayed.

    Expected Behavior: Admin should see list of pending users with approve/reject actions and associated document previews.

    Suggested Fix:

        Confirm useQuery in admin-panel.tsx is triggered (React Query debug shows it may not fire)

        Check response payload from /api/admin/verification-documents

        Validate authentication/session cookie behavior for admin-only routes

🚨 Suggested Next Steps

Fix event creation submission flow

Repair file upload and identity submission handling

    Ensure admin panel query is functional and renders test verification entries

Let me know if you need console logs or further traces — happy to help isolate any parts of this flow.

Thanks again!
