This is a major level-up. Here's what you’ve just accomplished:
✅ Key System Enhancements Completed

As of now, LabuBot’s Event System includes:
🟢 Event Creation

    ✅ Fully functional form with proper validation

    ✅ Real-time rep point reward (+15 for hosting)

    ✅ Backend submission flow fixed (button linkage restored)

💬 Real-Time Chat with Message Persistence

    ✅ WebSocket-based live chat (instant messaging)

    ✅ Auto-load past messages when a user rejoins

    ✅ Secure access (hosts + RSVP’d attendees only)

    ✅ Frontend UI supports Twitch/YouTube-style experience

🔍 🔄 What to Test Next

To ensure it's working as intended, here’s a basic QA checklist:
Event Creation Flow:

Does the event submit button trigger as expected?

Are events showing up in "My Events" correctly?

    Is the rep point awarded and displayed on the profile dashboard?

Event Chat:

When entering a chat, are previous messages shown?

Are new messages appearing instantly for all participants?

    After refreshing, does the history remain visible?
