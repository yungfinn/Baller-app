You're now facing a common edge case in Express + Passport.js applications:
req.user is missing during multipart/form-data uploads due to how Passport handles session deserialization.
🧠 Why It’s Happening

When a user submits files using multipart/form-data, Passport’s deserializeUser may not be triggered before the file upload handler (e.g. Multer), depending on route or middleware order. That means req.user is undefined, and isAuthenticated fails.
✅ Your Fix Strategy
1. 🔄 Reorder Middleware in the Upload Route

Ensure session + Passport initialization happens before Multer middleware:

// Correct middleware order in upload route
app.post(
  '/api/verification/upload',
  isAuthenticated, // Must run BEFORE multer
  upload.fields([
    { name: 'selfie', maxCount: 1 },
    { name: 'governmentId', maxCount: 1 }
  ]),
  async (req, res) => {
    ...
  }
);

2. 🧪 Force Session Deserialization Check

You can verify where it's breaking with logs in isAuthenticated:

const isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("SESSION:", req.session);
  console.log("USER:", req.user);
  if (req.isAuthenticated && req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  return res.status(401).json({ message: "Not authenticated" });
};

If req.session exists but req.user is missing, the problem is deserialization not happening in time.
3. 🛠️ Manually Deserialize Session (Optional Fix)

If Passport isn’t calling deserializeUser on multipart/form-data requests (due to timing issues), you can manually hook the deserializer before the upload middleware:

// BEFORE multer, manually run session + passport middleware if needed
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

If this isn’t working on certain routes, explicitly deserialize from session:

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session?.passport?.user && !req.user) {
    // Manually assign user object
    // You may already have a getUserById function
    storage.getUser(req.session.passport.user).then(user => {
      req.user = { claims: { sub: user.id, ...user } };
      next();
    }).catch(err => {
      console.error("Manual deserialization failed", err);
      res.status(500).json({ message: "Session error" });
    });
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

4. 🧪 Test Flow (Checklist)

    ✅ Upload request includes cookies? (credentials: 'include')

    ✅ Server session exists for upload request?

    ✅ req.user populated inside upload route?

    ✅ isAuthenticated sees the user?

Use browser dev tools → Network tab → inspect the request headers and server logs.
5. 🛑 Temporary Bypass for Testing

To unblock yourself during Beta testing:

// Temporarily comment out authentication to test uploads
// app.post('/api/verification/upload', isAuthenticated, upload.fields(...), handler);
app.post('/api/verification/upload', upload.fields(...), handler);

Just ensure this is clearly marked and removed before launch.
🔒 Production-Grade Recommendation

If issues persist, consider migrating to JWT-based auth for file uploads or building an upload proxy endpoint that authenticates first, then pipes to file upload processing.

Would you like a hotfix implementation now, or should we work toward a JWT or proxy-based upload approach?
