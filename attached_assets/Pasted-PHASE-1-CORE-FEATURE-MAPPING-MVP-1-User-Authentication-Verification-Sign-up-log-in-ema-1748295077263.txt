PHASE 1: CORE FEATURE MAPPING (MVP)
1. User Authentication & Verification

    Sign up / log in (email, phone, or social login)

    Optional identity verification (badge on profile)

2. User Preferences Setup

    Gender identity (to match or filter games)

    Sports of interest (multi-select: basketball, soccer, etc.)

    Skill level (Beginner, Recreational, Collegiate, Professional)

    Search radius (slider up to 100mi)

3. Location & Event Hosting

    Verified users can suggest event locations (dropdown w/ map pin: park, school, gym, etc.)

    Create an event: sport type, skill level, max players, time, date, notes (e.g. bring water)

    Admin/mod approval if needed for public hosting

4. Event Discovery

    Grid View: Card-style layout of upcoming events with filters applied

    Swipe View (Tinder-style):

        Swipe right to join/show interest

        Swipe left to skip

        "Details" button opens full event info

üõ†Ô∏è PHASE 2: FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS & BACKEND LOGIC
Matchmaking & Filtering

    Query system that pulls events within user‚Äôs radius + filters (sport, gender, level)

Event Management

    RSVP system: track who‚Äôs in

    Event cap enforcement

    Waitlist if full

Notifications

    Reminders before events

    Alerts if event is canceled or changed

Map Integration

    Google Maps or OpenStreetMap integration for event pins

üì± PHASE 3: UI/UX STRUCTURE
App Pages (Rough Wireframe)

    Welcome / Onboarding

    Preferences Setup

    Home View (Tab: Grid / Swipe)

    Event Detail View

    Create/Host Event

    My Events

    Profile

    Verification Upload (if needed)

UX/UI Notes:

    Keep Tinder swipe interactions lightweight and social

    Use color-coded badges for levels (e.g., green for beginner, red for pro)

    Profile icons should show availability + verification badge if applicable

üîß PHASE 4: REPLIT BASE MODEL SETUP

Let‚Äôs get ready to build by scaffolding the app with:

    React + Tailwind UI (for swipe + grid views)

    Firebase or Supabase (auth, database, event handling)

    Mapbox or Google Maps API

    Basic routing with React Router or Next.js
