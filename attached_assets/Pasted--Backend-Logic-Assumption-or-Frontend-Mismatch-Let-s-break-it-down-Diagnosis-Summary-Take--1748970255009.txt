⚠️ Backend Logic Assumption or Frontend Mismatch

Let’s break it down:
🔎 Diagnosis Summary
✅ "Take a Selfie" shows a checkmark

    That likely means:

        The selfie file upload request succeeded (manually or via test).

        The backend created a verification document with documentType: "selfie" for your user.

        The frontend saw this and marked the UI as complete for that section.

❌ "Upload ID" fails with "Upload failed"

    That suggests:

        The second file upload (government ID) isn't being submitted correctly.

        Or it is sent, but the backend rejects or errors out during processing.

✅ Immediate Fix Path
1. 🛠 Ensure FormData Handles Both Fields Properly

Make sure both files are being sent in the same form submission:

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("selfie", selfieFile);
formData.append("governmentId", idFile);

await fetch("/api/verification/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
  credentials: "include"
});

Sometimes if governmentId is null or undefined, the backend may not handle it gracefully.
2. 🔍 Check Upload Route for Both Fields

In /api/verification/upload, confirm this logic exists:

upload.fields([
  { name: 'selfie', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'governmentId', maxCount: 1 }
])

Then inside the handler:

const selfieFile = req.files?.selfie?.[0];
const idFile = req.files?.governmentId?.[0];

if (!selfieFile || !idFile) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: "Both selfie and ID are required" });
}

If your backend currently assumes both fields will be present, but the frontend sometimes only submits one — you’ll get silent errors or broken logic.
3. ✅ Implement Field-Level Success Feedback (Optional but Best Practice)

Make the frontend track upload response per file so the checkmark only appears after successful API return.
🔁 Test Plan

    Log in and open DevTools → Network

    Submit both selfie and ID

    Check:

        What’s being sent? (Is governmentId included?)

        What’s the backend response?

        Any logs from backend for missing or malformed data?

💡 Optional Enhancement

If needed, split the upload into two separate endpoints: /upload-selfie and /upload-id. This simplifies debugging and lets you give users real-time feedback per file.
