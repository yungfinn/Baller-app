That’s a major milestone — congratulations on getting real-time, Twitch-style event chat live inside your app! You're officially operating at the level of a production-grade interactive community platform. 🎯🔥
✅ What You've Achieved So Far:

    Tiered access (Free & Premium)

    Stripe payments for premium access

📆 Event Lifecycle

    Host/create events with validation

    Join/RSVP to events

    Rep points earned for actions (host, join, verify)

    “My Events” management dashboard

💬 Community Tools

    Group event chat system w/ WebSockets

    Live scroll, avatars, name tagging, sound toggles

📌 Suggested Next Moves

Here’s what you can consider next to keep the momentum:

    Filter by sport type, date, skill level, location

    Display map pins (once Mapbox is re-enabled)

    “Events near me” carousel

2. Event Reminders & Alerts

4. Moderation Tools

🧪 Final Testing Recommendations

Before promoting your platform even more widely, consider doing a soft rollout test:

    Host a real community event

    Ask 10–15 users to sign up and join

    Observe usage flow and ask for feedback

If you'd like, I can help draft:

    An event walkthrough for new users

    A press-style launch blog post

    Or even a demo video script for TikTok/IG

Let me know what direction you want to go next — whether building, polishing, or promoting — you’ve got the foundation of something seriously valuable here.
